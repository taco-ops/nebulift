## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd nebulift

# Install dependencies with uv (recommended)
uv sync

# Or with pip
pip install -e .
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from nebulift.fits_processor import FITSProcessor
from nebulift.cv_prefilter import ArtifactDetector
from nebulift.ml_model import AstroQualityClassifier

# Initialize components
processor = FITSProcessor()
detector = ArtifactDetector()
model = AstroQualityClassifier(num_classes=2, pretrained=False)

# Process a FITS file
fits_data = processor.load_fits_file("telescope_image.fits")
normalized = processor.normalize_image(fits_data['image_data'])

# Analyze for artifacts
analysis = detector.comprehensive_analysis(normalized)
print(f"Quality score: {analysis['overall_quality_score']:.3f}")
print(f"Has artifacts: {analysis['streaks']['has_streaks']}")
print(f"Needs review: {analysis['needs_manual_review']}")

# Prepare for ML inference
ml_ready = processor.resize_for_ml(normalized)
# (Model training/inference code would go here)
```

### Distributed Training on Kubernetes

For training on Raspberry Pi 5 clusters or multi-node setups:

```bash
# Build Docker image for ARM64
docker build -t nebulift:latest .

# Apply Kubernetes manifests
kubectl apply -f k8s/

# Monitor training progress
kubectl logs -f job/nebulift-training

# Scale training across more nodes
kubectl patch job nebulift-training -p '{"spec":{"parallelism":8}}'
```

### Complete ML Training Pipeline

Train a quality assessment model directly from FITS files using CV-generated labels:

```bash
# Complete training pipeline from FITS directory
nebulift train-from-fits /telescope_data/session_20240909/ \
    --model_output models/quality_classifier.pth \
    --dataset_dir datasets/organized_training \
    --epochs 50 \
    --clean_threshold 0.7 \
    --contaminated_threshold 0.3

# Monitor training progress and results
# Automatically generates: labeled training data, organized datasets, trained model
```

### System Validation
```bash
# Run complete system validation
uv run python validate_system.py
```
