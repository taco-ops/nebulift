# Nebulift: Astrophotography Quality Assessment

## ðŸŒŸ Project Complete: Implementation Summary

This repository contains a complete implementation of an **automated astrophotography quality assessment system** using ResNet18 for telescope data in FITS format. The system identifies and filters out poor-quality images contaminated with artifacts like satellite streaks, airplane trails, and clouds.

## âœ… Completed Features

### ðŸ”§ Core Components
- **FITS Processor** (`nebulift/fits_processor.py`): Professional astronomical image loading, normalization, and preprocessing
- **CV Pre-filter** (`nebulift/cv_prefilter.py`): Traditional computer vision artifact detection using Hough transforms and texture analysis
- **ML Model** (`nebulift/ml_model.py`): ResNet18-based binary classifier for quality assessment with CPU optimization

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Capabilities
- âœ… **FITS File Support**: Native support for astronomical FITS files with metadata extraction
- âœ… **Artifact Detection**: Automated detection of satellite streaks, airplane trails, and clouds
- âœ… **CPU Optimization**: Designed for laptops and Raspberry Pi 5 (no GPU required)
- âœ… **Semi-Automated Training**: CV pre-filter generates training labels for ML model
- âœ… **Quality Scoring**: Comprehensive quality assessment with manual review recommendations
- âœ… **Batch Processing**: Efficient processing of large image collections

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd nebulift

# Install dependencies with uv (recommended)
uv sync

# Or with pip
pip install -e .
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from nebulift.fits_processor import FITSProcessor
from nebulift.cv_prefilter import ArtifactDetector
from nebulift.ml_model import AstroQualityClassifier

# Initialize components
processor = FITSProcessor()
detector = ArtifactDetector()
model = AstroQualityClassifier(num_classes=2, pretrained=False)

# Process a FITS file
fits_data = processor.load_fits_file("telescope_image.fits")
normalized = processor.normalize_image(fits_data['image_data'])

# Analyze for artifacts
analysis = detector.comprehensive_analysis(normalized)
print(f"Quality score: {analysis['overall_quality_score']:.3f}")
print(f"Has artifacts: {analysis['streaks']['has_streaks']}")
print(f"Needs review: {analysis['needs_manual_review']}")

# Prepare for ML inference
ml_ready = processor.resize_for_ml(normalized)
# (Model training/inference code would go here)
```

### System Validation
```bash
# Run complete system validation
uv run python validate_system.py
```

## ðŸ“Š Test Results

- **54 comprehensive tests** with **89% code coverage**
- **Property-based testing** with Hypothesis for robust validation
