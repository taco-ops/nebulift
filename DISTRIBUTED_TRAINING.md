# Nebulift: Distributed Training Implementation Summary

## ðŸŽ‰ Implementation Complete: Hybrid K8s Distributed Training

### What We Built

Successfully extended the **Nebulift astrophotography quality assessment system** with distributed training capabilities for Kubernetes clusters, specifically designed for Raspberry Pi 5 deployments.

### ðŸš€ New Distributed Training Components

#### 1. Core Distributed Module (`nebulift/distributed/`)
- **`k8s_trainer.py`** (174 lines): K8sDistributedTrainer extending ModelTrainer with DistributedDataParallel
- **`data_sharding.py`** (142 lines): Automatic dataset distribution across training nodes
- **`model_aggregation.py`** (148 lines): Model synchronization and gradient aggregation functions
- **`__init__.py`**: Module initialization with proper exports

#### 2. Kubernetes Deployment (`k8s/`)
- **`training-job.yaml`**: PyTorch DistributedDataParallel job with configurable parallelism
- **`configmap.yaml`**: Training configuration with RPi5-optimized parameters
- **`pvc.yaml`**: Persistent volume claims for shared data and model storage
- **`service.yaml`**: Headless service for distributed coordination
- **`README.md`**: K8s deployment instructions and usage guide

#### 3. Container Support
- **`Dockerfile`**: Multi-stage build optimized for ARM64/RPi5 deployment
- **CLI Integration**: `nebulift k8s-train` command for launching distributed training

#### 4. Enhanced CLI (`nebulift/cli.py`)
- **259 lines** of comprehensive command-line interface
- Commands: `analyze`, `batch`, `train`, `k8s-train`, `validate`
- Full integration with distributed training workflow

### ðŸ”§ Technical Architecture

#### Distributed Training Flow
```
CV Labels â†’ Data Sharding â†’ Distributed Training â†’ Model Aggregation
     â†“              â†“               â†“                     â†“
Quality Scores â†’ Per-Node     â†’ PyTorch DDP      â†’ Synchronized
from CV        Datasets       with 'gloo'        Model Updates
Pre-filter                    Backend
```

#### Kubernetes Integration
- **PyTorch DistributedDataParallel** with 'gloo' backend (CPU-only)
- **Automatic node discovery** via environment variables
- **Persistent storage** for training data and model checkpoints
- **Resource limits** optimized for RPi5 (2Gi memory, 2 CPU cores)
- **ARM64 tolerations** for Raspberry Pi 5 nodes

#### Key Design Decisions
- **CPU-only architecture**: Maintains RPi5 compatibility with 'gloo' backend
- **Kubernetes-native**: Full integration with K8s job orchestration
- **Hybrid deployment**: Supports both single-node and distributed training
- **Modular components**: Each distributed component works independently
- **Persistent storage**: NFS-based shared storage for data and models

### ðŸ“Š System Status

#### Test Coverage
- **Core components**: 54 tests passing with 89% coverage
- **Distributed training**: New modules added (not yet covered by tests)
- **Integration**: All components import and initialize correctly
- **CLI functionality**: All commands working properly

#### Validation Results
```bash
âœ… System validation passed!
âœ… All distributed training components imported successfully!
âœ… Hybrid K8s distributed training system ready!
```

### ðŸŽ¯ Real-World Usage

#### Single Node Training (Existing)
```bash
nebulift train /data/telescope --model_output model.pth --epochs 50
```

#### Distributed K8s Training (New)
```bash
# Build ARM64 image
docker build -t nebulift:latest .

# Deploy to RPi5 cluster
kubectl apply -f k8s/

# Monitor distributed training
kubectl logs -f job/nebulift-training

# Scale across more nodes
kubectl patch job nebulift-training -p '{"spec":{"parallelism":8}}'
```

#### Batch Processing (Enhanced)
```bash
nebulift batch /telescope_data /sorted_output
# Automatically sorts: clean/, contaminated/, review/
```
