# ML Training Pipeline - Phase 1 Complete

## 🎉 Implementation Summary

**Phase 1 Complete**: The ML training pipeline is now fully implemented and ready for real-world deployment. This represents the complete semi-automated training workflow outlined in the original requirements.

## ✅ What We Built

### 🔧 Complete Training Pipeline Components

#### 1. CV Label Generation (`generate_training_labels_from_cv`)

- **Configurable thresholds**: Clean (>0.7) and contaminated (<0.3) with review queue for uncertain cases
- **FITS support**: Full integration with FITSProcessor for astronomical data
- **Batch processing**: Efficiently processes large collections of telescope images

#### 2. Dataset Creation (`create_dataset_from_cv_labels`)
- **Automated dataset organization**: Creates train/val/review directory structure
- **PyTorch integration**: Generates ready-to-use AstroImageDataset instances
- **Metadata tracking**: JSON metadata with dataset statistics and configuration
- **File management**: Automatically copies and organizes FITS files by quality labels

#### 3. Complete Training Pipeline (`complete_training_pipeline`)
- **End-to-end workflow**: From raw FITS files to trained ResNet18 model
- **Configurable parameters**: Epochs, batch size, learning rate, quality thresholds
- **Training monitoring**: Automatic model saving, loss tracking, accuracy metrics
- **Results reporting**: Comprehensive training results with final metrics

#### 4. Enhanced CLI Interface
- **`train-from-fits` command**: Complete pipeline for training from FITS directories
- **Flexible parameters**: Quality thresholds, training configuration, output paths
- **Progress monitoring**: Real-time training progress and final results
- **Help documentation**: Comprehensive help for all training options

#### 5. FITS-Aware Batch Processing

- **Unified interface**: Single function for processing mixed image collections

## 🚀 Real-World Usage Examples

### 1. Quick Training from Observatory Data
```bash
# Train model from telescope session
nebulift train-from-fits /observatory/night_2024_09_09/ \
    --model_output models/quality_classifier.pth \
    --dataset_dir datasets/sep09_training \
    --epochs 50 \
    --clean_threshold 0.8 \
    --contaminated_threshold 0.2
```

### 2. Custom Threshold Training
```bash
# Conservative thresholds for high-quality data
nebulift train-from-fits /telescope_data/m31_session/ \
    --model_output models/m31_classifier.pth \
    --dataset_dir datasets/m31_training \
    --clean_threshold 0.9 \
    --contaminated_threshold 0.1 \
    --batch_size 16 \
    --epochs 100
```

### 3. Programmatic Training Pipeline
```python
from nebulift.ml_model import complete_training_pipeline
from pathlib import Path

# Complete automated training
results = complete_training_pipeline(
    fits_directory=Path("/data/telescope_images"),
    model_output_path=Path("models/trained_classifier.pth"),
    dataset_output_dir=Path("datasets/organized"),
    epochs=75,
    batch_size=32,
    clean_threshold=0.75,
    contaminated_threshold=0.25
)

print(f"Training complete! Best accuracy: {results['final_metrics']['best_val_accuracy']:.2f}%")
print(f"Training samples: {results['dataset_stats']['training_samples']}")
print(f"Files for review: {results['dataset_stats']['review_files']}")
```

### 4. Manual Review Workflow
```python
from nebulift.ml_model import generate_training_labels_from_cv
from nebulift.cv_prefilter import ArtifactDetector
from pathlib import Path

# Generate labels with human review
detector = ArtifactDetector()
fits_files = list(Path("/data").glob("*.fits"))

labeled_files, labels, review_files = generate_training_labels_from_cv(
    fits_files, detector, 
    clean_threshold=0.8,
    contaminated_threshold=0.2
)

print(f"Ready for training: {len(labeled_files)} files")
print(f"Need human review: {len(review_files)} files")

# Process review files manually before training
for review_file in review_files:
    # Human review workflow here
    pass
```

## 📊 Training Pipeline Validation

### Performance Characteristics
- **FITS support**: Native astronomical data format handling
- **Batch processing**: Efficient analysis of large image collections
- **Memory efficient**: Designed for resource-constrained environments
- **CPU optimized**: No GPU required, works on Raspberry Pi 5
- **Scalable**: Supports both single-node and distributed training

## 🎯 Semi-Automated Training Workflow

The implemented pipeline follows the exact workflow described in the original requirements:

### 1. **CV Analysis Phase**
```
FITS Files → FITSProcessor → CV Pre-filter → Quality Scores
```
- Load astronomical images with proper FITS handling
- Apply traditional computer vision artifact detection
- Generate quality scores (0.0 to 1.0 range)

### 2. **Label Generation Phase**
```
Quality Scores → Threshold Logic → Binary Labels + Review Queue
```
- **Clean**: Score ≥ 0.7 → Label = 1 (good for stacking)
- **Contaminated**: Score ≤ 0.3 → Label = 0 (discard)
- **Review**: 0.3 < Score < 0.7 → Human review needed

### 3. **ML Training Phase**
```
Labeled Data → Dataset Creation → ResNet18 Training → Quality Classifier
```
- Organize files into train/validation splits
- Create PyTorch datasets with proper transforms
- Train ResNet18 binary classifier
- Save trained model for inference

### 4. **Production Deployment**
```
Trained Model → Quality Prediction → Automated Image Sorting
```
- Deploy trained classifier for real-time quality assessment
- Integrate with astrophotography processing workflows
- Automate pre-stacking quality control
